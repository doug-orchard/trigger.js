# trigger.js
A simple event based toggle classes script for markup based actions.

Version 1.0.0

Sometimes all you need is a simple way to handle events on your site that apply a state class on a HTML element.

The jQuery way makes you add javascript or each event manually, trigger.js does away with this premise and jQuery and allows you to attach events without any javascript added ( other then trigger.js ).

trigger.js purpose is only to allow you to create simple UI effects with little effort. Define atttributes on the element in the HTML what type of action ( 'click' ), the target element that you want to toggle a className action and vioia! EVENTS!

The rest is up to you.

## How it works
Trigger.js will search for all elements on the page with the class of "trigger" and attached an event that is based on the attributes ( see below 'Attributes required' ) on said element.

## Attributes required

place these on the element that will trigger the event.

"data-event" - the event type, eg. 'click', 'ouseOver' -- see events page on MDN
"data-target" - an array string of the elements to target eg. data-target=".sidemenu, .header, footer"
"data-action" - the class you wish to add to the target element

## Example.

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
		<title>trigger.js</title>
	</head>
	<body>

		<h1>trigger.js example</h1>

		<button class="trigger" data-action="click" data-target=".sidemenu" data-trigger="open">Click me</button>

		<div class="sidemenu">
			<ul>
				...
			</ul>
		</div>

	</body>
	</html>

	.sidemenu{
		width: 300px;
		position:fixed;
		background-color: #333;
		color: #fff;
		right: 0;
		top: 0;
		height: 100%;
		-webkit-transform: translateX( 100% );
		    -ms-transform: translateX( 100% );
		        transform: translateX( 100% );
		-webkit-transition: all 200ms ease;
		        transition: all 200ms ease;
	}

	.sidemenu--open{
		-webkit-transform: translateX( 0% );
		    -ms-transform: translateX( 0% );
		        transform: translateX( 0% );
	}
