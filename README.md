# trigger.js
A simple event based toggle classes script for markup based actions.

Version 1.0.0

What does this all mean Bazil?

Simply put, use HTML to create fast and easy toggle events on the UI. Say you want to toggle a sidemenu for instance. In the past you had to create a script tag and use either jQuery's toolset or vanillia JS way. Either way ended up having too many of these events littered through your scripts. With trigger.js, all you have to do is add the script, add an trigger element and then target what you want to modify. trigger.js does the rest. It will take the first class of the target and adds a modifier class in the vain of BEM. All you need to do is make the CSS. SIMPLES!

Now you can create events that trigger UI based actions with just changes to your markup and CSS only.

Is it that simple?

Pretty much. Have look at the example below and or try the link to the JSbin.com example to see it in action.

Now, the rest is up to you.

Also it's super small!!! ( That's what she said? ).

## How it works
trigger.js will search for all elements on the page with the class of "trigger" and attached an event that is based on the attributes ( see below 'Attributes required' ) on said element.

## Attributes required

place these on the element that will trigger the event.

"data-event" - the event type, eg. 'click', 'mouseover' - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
"data-target" - an array string of the elements to target eg. data-target=".sidemenu, .header, footer"
"data-action" - the class you wish to add to the target element

## Example.

```html
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
		<title>trigger.js</title>
		<style>
			.sidemenu{
				width: 300px;
				position:fixed;
				background-color: #333;
				color: #fff;
				right: 0;
				top: 0;
				height: 100%;
				-webkit-transform: translateX( 100% );
					-ms-transform: translateX( 100% );
						transform: translateX( 100% );
				-webkit-transition: all 200ms ease;
						transition: all 200ms ease;
			}

			.sidemenu--open{
				-webkit-transform: translateX( 0% );
					-ms-transform: translateX( 0% );
						transform: translateX( 0% );
			}
		</style>
	</head>
	<body>

		<h1>trigger.js example</h1>

		<button class="trigger" data-action="click" data-target=".sidemenu" data-trigger="open">Click me</button>

		<div class="sidemenu">
			<ul>
				...
			</ul>
		</div>

		<script src="link/to/trigger.js"></script>

	</body>
	</html>
```
